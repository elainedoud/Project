# Project - Popular Java

This web application displays information for 30 popular Java repos at a time.
In addition to the names of the repos, their size and created at date/time is 
displayed as well.

Their is a search bar where the name of a repo can be entered to bring it up quickly.

For a note of whimsy, I also included a fun fact of the day which pulls
from a trivia api.


To view the web application, follow the below steps:
    1. Fork and download the github repository to your computer
    2. Within the file, type "npm install http-server -g" and enter
    3. Then type "http-server"
    4. Go to your browser and type http://localhost:8080/App.html to view the web application
